# Machine-Learning-E-Portfolio-UK-Department-for-Transport-Road-Safety-2023-Data


In 2023, approximately 23,000 road collisions were recorded across London boroughs. While the majority resulted in minor injuries, around 3,500 involved serious harm such as burns or fractures, and 101 incidents led to at least one fatality (Trust for London, 2025). The project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of road traffic incidents using features related to driver behaviour, vehicle type, and environmental conditions.
To support predictive modelling, four datasets from the Department for Transport were merged, cleansed, and partitioned into training and testing subsets. Irrelevant variables were removed, and the data underwent imputation, log transformation, and outlier detection to optimise model performance. The resulting insights supported the boroughs of Lambeth, Wandsworth, Croydon, Westminster, and Southwark in designing data-informed road safety interventions and awareness initiatives.
