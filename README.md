In 2023, ~23,000 road collisions occurred in London; 3,500 caused serious injury and 101 were fatal. This project merges and cleans four datasets to build a machine learning model predicting accident severity using driver, vehicle, and environmental factors, to support the top 5 most affected London boroughs improve their road safety.
