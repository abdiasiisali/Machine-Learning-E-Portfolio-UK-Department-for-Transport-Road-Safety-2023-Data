In 2023, approximately 23,000 road collisions were recorded across London boroughs. While the majority resulted in minor injuries, around 3,500 involved serious harm such as burns or fractures, and 101 incidents led to at least one fatality (Trust for London, 2025). Transport for London’s Vision Zero initiative set an ambitious goal: to eliminate all deaths and
 serious injuries from London’s transport network by 2041 (Transport for London, 2023). Central to this vision is the use of data-driven strategies to enhance road safety and influence driver behaviour. 
 
This project aimed to develop a machine learning model to predict the severity of road traffic incidents using features related to driver behaviour, vehicle type, and environmental conditions. To support predictive modelling, four datasets from the Department for Transport were merged, cleansed, and partitioned into training and testing subsets. Irrelevant variables were removed, and the data underwent imputation, log transformation, and outlier detection to optimise model performance. Subsequently four models — Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were trained using validated 2023 accident data, as the 2024 dataset has not yet been fully verified. Each model's performance was compared against a baseline to select the most effective and practical model.
 
 The resulting insights supported the boroughs of Lambeth, Wandsworth, Croydon, Westminster, and Southwark in designing data-informed road proactive safety interventions and awareness initiatives by identifying high-risk scenarios and patterns
